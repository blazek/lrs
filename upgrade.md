## LRS Plugin Upgrade 2017

### Foreword

The LRS Plugin was originally written in 2013 when QGIS internal geometry data structure was limited to x,y coordinates and it was not supporting so called measure (M) coordinate, which is common way to store linear reference data directly in geometry without additional tables. That is why current implementation (2/2017) of the plugin does not support such layers as input and output. It can only write directly to PostGIS. The QGIS geometry classes were refactored in the mean time, which makes it possible to use QGIS layers with measure both for input and output.
 
The current implementation is strongly targeted to maintenance and error detection of data based on routes and milestones, which was the most important feature for plugin funder, [Provincia Autonoma di Trento - Dipartimento infrastrutture e mobilit√†](http://www.provincia.tn.it/). There are however other users, who do not need calibration at all or who need to use different method for the calibration, based on attribute data describing segment measures.
 
The main idea of plugin upgrade is to separate tools for calibration and tools for usage. Standard QGIS layers will be used as an intermediate format. Calibrated data will be created as a memory layer, which may be exported by standard 'Save as' tool as Shapefile or PostGIS or any other format supporting measure which is supported by QGIS. The same applies to input for other tools. Any layer with measure supported by QGIS will be available as input for events generation, localization or event measure calculation.

Last but not least, the plugin has to be upgraded to the comming QGIS 3, which is using new Qt and Python version and which has different QGIS API. The upgraded plugin will be available for QGIS 3. QGIS 2.x versions will not be supported.

### Terminology
* LRS layer - layer with measures (with M coordinates)
* Milestone - point with route and measure attributes
